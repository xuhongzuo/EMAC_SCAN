# EMAC_SCAN
An outlier detection (anomaly detection) algorithm for categorical data.


This is source code of the method proposed in "Embedding-Based Complex Feature Value Coupling
Learning for Detecting Outliers in Non-IID Categorical Data". 


A sample dataset is in "data" folder. The expected dataset should be in csv format, and the attribute/feature is supposed to be categorical/nominal. main.py is used to perform and evalute the outlier detection process. You may also want to find sample usage of our method in main.py.
